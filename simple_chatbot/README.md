### **Simple Chatbot Program**

This is a fun, beginner-friendly chatbot project that lets you create a basic conversational bot. It’s designed to match what you type with predefined responses and gives a fallback reply when it doesn’t understand something. Perfect for learning or just having fun with Python!

---

### **Features**
1. **Ready-to-Use Responses:** The chatbot recognizes keywords like "hello," "how are you," and "bye" and responds accordingly.
2. **Fallback Options:** If the chatbot doesn’t recognize your input, it has a default response ready.
3. **Randomized Replies:** It keeps things interesting by picking a random response from its list every time.

---

### **How to Use It**
1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer. If not, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Copy the chatbot code into a file, for example, `simple_chatbot.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the script with:
   ```bash
   python simple_chatbot.py
   ```
5. Start chatting with the bot by typing your messages!

### **What It Does**
1. **Understands Inputs:** The chatbot looks for specific keywords in your messages and replies accordingly.
2. **Keeps It Fresh:** Responses are picked randomly, so it feels less repetitive.
3. **Exits Gracefully:** Just type "bye," and the chatbot will say goodbye and end the chat.

### **Make It Your Own**
- Want the chatbot to recognize more phrases? Add them to the `responses` dictionary in the code.
- Looking for a challenge? You can upgrade the bot with libraries like `NLTK` or `spaCy` for more complex conversations.

Chatbot: Hello! Type 'bye' to exit.
You: Hello
Chatbot: Hey! What's up?
You: How are you?
Chatbot: I’m just a bot, but I’m doing great!
You: Bye
Chatbot: Goodbye!
```
