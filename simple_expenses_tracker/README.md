# Simple Expense Tracker Application

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm learning Python, and this is one of the projects I created to practice my skills. Itâ€™s a straightforward program to track your expenses while helping me understand programming basics like loops, conditionals, lists, and input validation. If you're also exploring Python, this might give you a good starting point!

---

## Features

1. **Add Expense**  
   - Record an item name and cost with input validation.  
   - Handles invalid or empty inputs gracefully.

2. **View Expenses**  
   - Displays all recorded expenses in a neat list.  
   - Shows the total amount spent so far.

3. **Exit Option**  
   - Ends the program when you're finished.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system. If not, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).  
2. Save the code to a file, e.g., `expense_tracker.py`.  
3. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the file location, and run:
   ```bash
   python expense_tracker.py
   ```

## Why I Built This

I wanted a practical, hands-on way to learn Python by creating something functional and meaningful. This project allowed me to apply core programming concepts in a real-world context, while also building a small, useful tool that I can expand on in the future.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Here are a few ideas to expand the project:
1. **Add Categories**: Organize expenses into categories like Food, Transport, and Entertainment.  
2. **Save Data**: Allow users to save and load expenses with files (e.g., CSV or JSON).  
3. **Visualize Spending**: Add charts or graphs using Matplotlib or Seaborn to analyze spending trends.  
4. **Build an App**: Convert it into a web or mobile application using Flask, Django, or React Native.  
5. **Deploy Online**: Host your app on Heroku, AWS, or another platform to make it accessible to others.
